## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
-   [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
-   [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd lexileap
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Bun for package management.
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the local development server, which includes the Vite frontend and the local Wrangler server for the backend, run:

```bash
bun run dev
```

This will start the frontend on `http://localhost:3000` (or another available port) and the Cloudflare Worker locally. The Vite development server is configured to proxy API requests to the worker, so you can interact with the full application seamlessly.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

-   `src/`: Contains the React frontend application code.
    -   `pages/`: Top-level page components.
    -   `components/`: Reusable UI components.
    -   `lib/`: Utilities, API clients, and mock data.
-   `worker/`: Contains the Cloudflare Worker backend code (Hono API).
-   `shared/`: TypeScript types and data shared between the frontend and backend.
-   `public/`: Static assets.

## üîß Development

### Frontend

The frontend is a standard Vite + React application. You can create new components, pages, and hooks inside the `src` directory. Styling is done using Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.

### Backend

The backend is a Hono application running on Cloudflare Workers. API routes are defined in `worker/user-routes.ts`. Data persistence is handled by a single global Durable Object, abstracted via Entity classes in `worker/entities.ts`.

## ÈÉ®ÁΩ≤ (Deployment)

This application is designed to be deployed to the Cloudflare global network.

1.  **Login to Wrangler:**
    Authenticate the Wrangler CLI with your Cloudflare account.
    ```bash
    wrangler login
    ```

2.  **Build and Deploy:**
    The `deploy` script in `package.json` handles building the frontend and deploying the worker.
    ```bash
    bun run deploy
    ```

This command will build the static assets, bundle the worker code, and deploy everything to your Cloudflare account.

Alternatively, you can deploy your own version of this project with a single click.
